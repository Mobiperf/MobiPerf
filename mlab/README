MobiPerf Server Deployment Guide

Step 1:
Change the definition of the ROOT_DIR in mobiperf_server server/src/common/Definition.java (read the comments above ROOT_DIR definition for more details)
Change the definition of the SERVER_NAME in mobiperf cilent client/src/com/mobiperf/Definition.java (read the comments above SERVER_NAME definition for more details)

Step 2:
Run "ifconfig" on your server and get the name of the active network interface, say it's "eth1".
Change run/tcpdump_init.sh  run/tcp_reach_init.sh
Change "sudo ./tcpdump$2 -i eth0" to be "sudo ./tcpdump$2 -i yourInterfaceName" replace yourInterfaceName with you actual interface name

Step 3:
Compile server
Run "bash compile.sh" in the current directory to compile a list of server modules

Step 4:
Upload the whole "run" directory into your server (you don't need to include "run" directory itself)

Step 5:
run "bash restart.sh" from "run" directory
make sure 21 25 53 110 135 139 143 161 445 465 585 587 993 995 5060 6881 5223 5228 8080 ports are able to be bind for TCP/UDP, and 80, 22, 443 for UDP

Following is a list of commands help for unbinding already occupied ports (warning: service provided on these ports by your server will be affected)
#for smtp
#sudo /etc/init.d/postfix stop
#sudo lsof -i | grep "LISTEN" | grep "smtp"
 
#for smb/netbios
#sudo /etc/init.d/smbd stop

#for 8080
#sudo lsof -i :8080
#sudo lsof -i | grep "LISTEN" | grep "netbios"
