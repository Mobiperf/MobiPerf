Overview of this code
---------------------

Mobiperf consists of an Android app that collects mobile network
measurements, and a data collection server, which runs on AppEngine.

The Android app periodically checks in with the measurement server,
which sends it a list of measurement tasks to perform. Measurement tasks
include ping, traceroute, HTTP GET, DNS lookup, TCP Throughput, IPv4/v6 
compatability check and UDP Burst. Each task has an associated set of 
measurement parameters (e.g., which host to ping), and a schedule
(periodicity at which to take the measurement).

The device runs the measurements in the background, and uploads the
measurement results on its next checkin cycle. By default, devices
check in with the server every hour. In order to avoid draining the
battery, the app will not take any measurements if the battery is
below a given threshold (80% by default).

The protocol spoken between the app and the server is a simple JSON
REST API, documented below.

The server is implemented using Google AppEngine. It is responsible
for managing device checkins, handing out measurement tasks, and
collecting results. It has a simple Web dashboard for presenting
measurement results to the user. There is also a mechanism for
querying measurement results.

Protocol Description
--------------------

The Mobiperf app communicates with the Mobiperf service using
the following protocol, using JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP POST
methods.

All strings representing dates and times are represented in ISO8601
format with a trailing Zindicating UTC, e.g.,
  2011-06-22T10:27:24.204589Z

/checkin - Used by devices to periodically check in with the service.

Input:

{
 "id": "device ID",
 /* Note that the user field is implied */
 "manufacturer": "device manufacturer",
 "model": "device model",
 "os": "device OS",
 "properties": {
    "timestamp": "timestamp in ISO8601 format",
    "os_version": "device OS version",
    "location": {
      "latitude": latitude value as floating point decimal degrees,
      "longitude": longitude value as floating point decimal degrees
    }
    "location_type": "location type string",
    "network_type": "network type string",
    "carrier": "carrier identifier string",
  }
}

Output: A list of JSON objects representing task descriptors for the
measurements that the device should perform. This schedule overwrites
any existing schedule on the device. Ongoing measurement tasks not
included in the new schedule are terminated immediately. If the
schedule is empty, the device will stop performing measurements.

[
  { "key": "optional task key",
    "type": "measurement type",
    "parameters": [
      { "paramName1": "paramValue1" },
      { "paramName2": "paramValue2" },
      ...
    ]
    "start_time": "task start time in ISO8601 format",
    "end_time": "task end time in ISO8601 format",
    "interval_sec": interval as an integer,
    "count": count as an integer,
    "priority": priority as an integer
  },
  { /* Additional Task... */ },
  { /* Additional Task... */ }
]

/postmeasurement - Used by the device to post a set of measurement
results to the service.

Input: JSON representation of a list of Measurement objects, with
embedded DeviceProperties.

  [ { "device_id": "device ID",
      "properties": {
      "timestamp": "timestamp in ISO8601 format",
      "os_version": "device OS version",
      "location": {
        "latitude": latitude value as floating point decimal degrees,
        "longitude": longitude value as floating point decimal degrees
       }
      "location_type": "location type string",
      "network_type": "network type string",
      "carrier": "carrier identifier string",
    }
    "type": "measurement type",
    "timestamp": "measurement timestamp in ISO8601 format",
    "success": true or false,
    "task_key": "task key associated with this measurement, if any",
    "parameters": [
        { "paramName1": "paramValue1" },
        { "paramName2": "paramValue2" },
        ...
    ],
    "values": [
        { "valueName1": "valueValue1" },
        { "valueName2": "valueValue2" },
        ...
    ],
  },
  { /* Additional Measurement... */ },
  { /* Additional Measurement... */ },
]

Output: A JSON-encoded representation of whether the post was
successful:

  { "success": true or false }
